If you wish to use the virus checking capabilities, here are some additional
steps that you need to take in order to enable this functionality.

- If you are installing fresh, note that there is no longer a settings.py file
included with the repository. Instead, copy the settings.py.example file to
settings.py and make configuration changes accordingly.

- In addition to the configuration described in the standard install documents,
edit the settings.py and find the ENABLE_CLAMD entry. Make sure that it is
equal to True (default is False).

- Virus scanning relies on the clamav daemon. Make sure you have it installed
and running. In Ubuntu, this is as simple as:
  sudo apt-get install clamav-daemon
  sudo freshclam

- From within your virtualenv, make sure that you have pyclamd installed. You
can install with:
  pip install pyclamd.
