## Overview

ETD Drop is a Django project+app providing a simple web application for
submitting Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs).

## Documentation

You can find the ETD Drop documentation online on Read The Docs:

http://premis-event-service.readthedocs.org/

The documentation is also browsable locally, within the `docs/source` 
directory of this repository. To build a local HTML version viewable offline, 
`cd` to the `docs` directory and run `make html`, and then open 
`docs/build/html/index.html`. (Be sure to have the dependencies listed in 
`requirements.txt` available before running `make html`.)
