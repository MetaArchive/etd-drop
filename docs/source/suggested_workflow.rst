Suggested Workflow
==================

ETD Drop is intentionally very simple, allowing for a multitude of options for 
how to implement your ETD program's workflow. For a basic use case, we might 
recommend the following ETD ingest workflow:

1. The student logs in to ETD Drop and submits their ETD and accompanying data.
2. An employee (or team of employees) takes the submission package from the 
   server and moves it to a location where they can work on creating a final 
   submission package suitable for the institutional repository. (This should 
   typically include verifying that the submitted files adhere to 
   institutional standards, creating cleaned metadata based on the information 
   submitted by the student, virus-checking, etc.)
3. At this point, the submission package should be deleted from the location 
   where ETD Drop created it.
