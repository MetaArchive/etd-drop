============
Installation
============

ETD Drop is distributed as a complete Django project, making it quite 
straightforward to run. It is essentially a WSGI application, needing only 
minor database-related setup and some Python package dependencies. Popular 
ways of running Django apps include gunicorn, nginx (with uwsgi), and Apache 
(with mod_wsgi).

System Requirements
-------------------

* Python 2.7.4 (or any higher 2.7.x release)
* virtualenv (strongly recommended)
* A writable directory large enough to accommodate your needs
